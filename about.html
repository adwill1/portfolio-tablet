                    Michigan College thrifts started as a passion project with a purpose, to educate others about the detrimental impacts that the fast fashion
                    indsutry has on the envrionemnt. Through our process of sourcing clothing second hand, we try to combat the idea that one needs new clothes to be fashionable and trendy. 
                    We provide fashionable, trendy, and affordable clothing for colleges in Michigan to encourage others to think about their consumption 
                    and take on a more sustainable lifestyle.
